Little exercise on mails and C++.
The purpose of the project is to automate the process of sending mail with new version of a certain software. It reads configuration files about user account, mail server and lets you specify a template for the mail generation. 
Obviously the same result can be better achieved by using some vcs but, like I said, it is only an exercise.
